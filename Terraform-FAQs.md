# What is terraform?

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows users to define and manage their infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. With Terraform, users can declare the desired state of their infrastructure in code, and Terraform will automatically create, update, and delete resources to match that state.

Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers and services, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and many more. It allows users to create complex infrastructure setups with ease and can also be used for managing on-premises infrastructure.

Terraform uses a declarative language to describe infrastructure, which means users can focus on the what and let Terraform figure out the how. It also supports modularity and reusability through the use of modules, which are collections of resources that can be reused across projects.

# What are the advantages of using Terraform in Azure?

Common IaC tool - used in Azure Portal.
Understand infrastructure changes before being applied.
Deploys the same template multiple times to create identical development, test, and production environments.
Unintended changes can be caught early in the development process.
